This is an introduction to the [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/) private preview for Reinforcement Learning using the [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/) framework.

Using these samples, you will be able to do the following.

1. Create an Azure ML workspace and computing clusters for running Ray.
2. Run some experiments training a reinforcement learning agent using Ray and rllib.

## Prerequisites

To make use of these samples, you need the following.

* Microsoft Azure subscription
* A Microsoft Azure resource group in one of the following regions: `eastus` or `westcentral` or `westeurope` or `southcentralus`.
* A virtual network set up in the resource group.
  * The `Workspace setup` notebook shows you how to create a virtual network.  Or you can use an existing one.
* An Azure Machine Learning Workspace in the resource group above.
  * Make sure to create the workspace in the same region as the resource group above.
    * The `Workspace setup` notebook shows you how to create a workspace from the network.

## Setup

You can run these samples in the following ways.

* On a Azure ML Notebook VM.
* On a workstation with Python and the Azure ML Python SDK installed.

### Azure ML Notebook VM

#### New Notebook VM

If you have a notebook VM created starting in December 2019, then the reinforcement learning SDK is already installed.  You can start using the sample notebooks right away.

#### Update Notebook VM

If you have a notebook VM created before December 2019, then update it and install the RL SDK using the following commands in a notebook cell.

```shell
# We recommend updating pip to the latest version.
!pip install --upgrade pip
# Update Azure ML SDK to the latest version
!pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk
# For Jupyter notebook widget used in samples
!pip install --upgrade azureml-widgets
# For Tensorboard integrated used in samples
!pip install --upgrade azureml-tensorboard
# Install Azure ML RL SDK
!pip install --upgrade azureml-contrib-reinforcementlearning
```

### Your own workstation

For a local workstation, create a Python environment and [install Azure ML SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py) and the RL SDK. We recommend Python 3.6 and higher.

```shell
# Activate your environment first.
# e.g.,
# conda activate amlrl
# We recommend updating pip to the latest version.
pip install --upgrade pip
# Update Azure ML SDK to the latest version
pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk
# For Jupyter notebook widget used in samples
pip install --upgrade azureml-widgets
# For Tensorboard integrated used in samples
pip install --upgrade azureml-tensorboard
# Install Azure ML RL SDK.
pip install --upgradeÂ azureml-contrib-reinforcementlearning
# To use the notebook widget, you may need to register and enable the Azure ML extensions first.
jupyter nbextension install --py --user azureml.widgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py --user azureml.widgets
```
